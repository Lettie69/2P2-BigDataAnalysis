# 2P2-BigDataAnalysis
Based on the customer loan record data set of a certain credit platform, association rule mining, principal component analysis, cluster analysis and classification prediction were conducted.


This project comprehensively uses Rapid Minor and Python to achieve complementary advantages and comprehensive analysis. It should be noted that only python code is uploaded here. Basically covers all analysis, but does not include association rules( So I also upload an code conducting association rule for reference. Model training for Classification Model 2 was interrupted during the last run due to insufficient storage(no space left on device).
